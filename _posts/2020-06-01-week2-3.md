Investigated the causes of anxiety among international graduate students at Florida Tech and analyzed the results of a survey on that topic. The number of students who reported experiencing each cause of anxiety was reported, and causes of anxiety were identified as trait based (eg. bad study habits) or circumstantial (eg. being in a foreign country). Addditionally, students' responses were analyzed for words with significant positive/negative connotations that may be associated with particular emotional states.
