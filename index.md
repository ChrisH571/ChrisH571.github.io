## About My Project

The goal of my project is to create a machine learning model that can identify individuals with anxiety based on their social media activity. This will be done by training the AI using social media posts from users with and without anxiety. The primary factor used by the model will be word choice, which is expected to have significant correlations with anxiety, but other factors such as post length and use of nonalphabetic symbols will also be considered. Although AI cannot replace an expert diagnosis for mental disorders such as anxiety, it can be useful to identify anxiety or anxious traits in undiagnosed individuals.
