## About My Project

The goal of my project is to create machine learning models that can identify individuals with anxiety. A first model will be done by training the AI using social media posts from users with and without anxiety. The primary factor used by the model will be word choice, which is expected to have significant correlations with anxiety, but other factors such as post length and use of nonalphabetic symbols will also be considered. This idea of using AI to identify anxiety will then be expanded to classify causes of anxiety in international graduate students. Although AI cannot replace an expert diagnosis for mental disorders such as anxiety, it can be useful to identify anxiety or anxious traits in undiagnosed individuals.
